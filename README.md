# VR Fitness Game Project

## Project Background
There are many fitness apps available that help users track their fitness activity, do workouts, do exercises & meal planning. However, the common problems are to get people to stay motivated and maintain a healthy exercise routine. It is trickier for people who are not used to tracking their activities. 

## Goal
The goal is to create a fun work out environment which help users start their fitness journey, stay motivated and get back on track when they slack off.

## Interviews
### Overview
Before developing an app, it is important to identify why people start their fitness journey, what their goals are, and what they need for them to keep going. In order to gather this information, I approached 2 groups of people:

- Group 1: people who just started their fitness journey: to learn why they want to work out, their goals, and what would help them to keep going
- Group 2: people who already been working out for more than a year: to learn how they started, what motivates them

### Interview questions
Group 1:
* How often do you work out?
* Do you want to start your fitness journey?
* What is your goal for working out?
* Do you know how to start your journey/need guidance for working out?
* Where do you look for guidance?
* Have you tried a fitness app? What was your experience?
* What do you expect the app to have?
* What would motivate you to keep working out?

Group 2:
- How often do you work out?
- What is your goal for working out?
- When did you start your fitness journey?
- Do you still need guidance for working out?
- Where did you look for guidance when you first started?
- Have you tried a fitness app? What was your experience?
- What would motivate you to work out?

### Persona
After conducting interviews, 2 personas are created for the 2 groups:

#### Group 1: Matthew G.

Demographics:
 - Age:	29 years
 - Gender:	Male
 - Occupation:	Registrar

Bio: Matthew works as a Registrar at a hospital. When he has free time, he wants to start working out to look better and to be stronger. However, he finds it difficult to start because he doesn't know anything about fitness or have any friends who does.

Goal:
 - Look good
 - Healthy lifestyle
 - Work out more often

Frustrations:
 - Not knowing how to start
 - Unmotivated to maintain a workout routine


#### Group 2: Carrie S.

Demographics:
 - Age:	19 years
 - Gender:	Feale
 - Occupation:	College student

Bio: Carrie is a college student who works out very often. Thanks to a friend she made at the gym, she learned a lot about what to do when she first started.

Goal:
 - Get fit
 - Be healthy
 - Feel better

Frustrations:
 - Fitness app feels unnecessary
- Want some fun challenges
- Need more connection with friends

### Takeaways:
- Beginners donâ€™t know how to start working out
- Some only wants to work out to keep their bodies moving to keep themselves active (not to bulk up or get super fit)
- They find it hard to keep themselves motivated
- They prefer to have more fun and interaction when working out, especially if they can compete with others and/or their friends

## Opportunities 
- Make working out more fun with VR
- Have clear guidelines for beginners
- Connect with friends to reach fitness goals together
- Daily challenges to get users to come back

## Competitors
### Hitstream
**Pros:** allow users to move in 360 degrees, encourage users to move side to side, might be good for beginners

**Cons:** lacking in obstacles that make you activate leg muscles, confusing banner, lack of competitiveness

### Supernatural
**Pros:** real-life instructors, includes warm ups and cool downs, leaderboards, can share progress with friends

**Cons:** high subscription price, unable to combine classes

### Thrill of the Fight
**Pros:** immersive, encourage users to give it their best, constant moving, punching and blocking, motivating

**Cons:** no way to track improvements like accuracy and speed, lack of training
