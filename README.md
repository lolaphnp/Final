# VR Fitness Game Project

## Project Background
There are many fitness apps available that help users track their fitness activity, do workouts, do exercises & meal planning. However, the common problems are to get people to stay motivated and maintain a healthy exercise routine. It is trickier for people who are not used to tracking their activities. 

## Goal
The goal is to create a fun work out environment which help users start their fitness journey, stay motivated and get back on track when they slack off.

## Interviews
### Overview
Before developing an app, it is important to identify why people start their fitness journey, what their goals are, and what they need for them to keep going. In order to gather this information, I approached 2 groups of people: 
Group 1: people who just started their fitness journey: to learn why they want to work out, their goals, and what would help them to keep going
Group 2: people who already been working out for more than a year: to learn how they started, what motivates them

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
